# Affine-transformation

This project was build to perform given affin transformation with dataset. Actually, rotating image around changed centre. 

Trasformation was made as composition of three other affine transformations: translation, rotation and again translation (coming back to the start point).

Result images (dataset, transformed dataset, and both figures that shows how transformation behaves) were displayed and saved.
